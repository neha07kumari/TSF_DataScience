## TASK 6- Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm

### The problem statement is from the given iris Dataset,we have to create the Decision Tree Classifier and Visualize it graphically. 
### Starting from importing the libraries followed by Data Exploration and Data Visualization. The very next step is to do a little of feature engineering. The target column is of Object type(categorical values), so we converted them to integer type using apply function on the column "Species". 
### After feature engineering , we started building our Decision-tree Classifier on our Train-dataset, keeping all parameters as dafualt, we fit our model. 
### After fitting, We did model testing on the unseen data followed by comparion predicted values with the actual values. 
### The last step: we did some evaluation which results in extreme good accuracy followed by visualization of a decision tree. Our model was trained efficiently and was able to predict the right values when feed with further unseen Data.
